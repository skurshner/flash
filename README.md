# Flash!

## React Flashcard Application

### [Live App](https://flashcard-app-sk.vercel.app/)

### Built using:

- React
- Tailwind CSS

### To run locally:

1. Run `npm i`
2. Run `npm start`

### Description

Flash! is a React-app for students to create their own decks of flashcards. Once created, they can use the "Study" function to test themselves.

The local version allows for full CRUD capability, but the live version does not. I plan to create a back-end for this app to give it the full functionality.
